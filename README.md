# Find Your Hat - Terminal Game
This is a command-line based game where the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes. The player must navigate through the field without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field to reach the hat.

## How to Play
To play the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install Node.js on your machine if you haven't already.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Type the command "node PlayGame.js" to start the game.
5. Follow the prompts to select the difficulty level and start the game.
6. Once the game starts, you will see a randomly generated field with a hat ('^') and holes ('O') scattered around. Your character is represented by an asterisk ('*') and you must move it through the field using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to find the hat without falling into a hole or moving outside of the field. The field is represented by a grid of path characters ('░') and field characters ('▓').

If you successfully find the hat, you win the game. If you fall into a hole or move outside of the field, you lose the game. You can choose to replay the game with the same or a different difficulty level or exit the game.
